Ferret is a class path scanning API for the Java platform. Unlike previous
class path scanning APIs, Ferret does not restrict scanning to only certain
types or force developers to learn a complicated and constricting query
language. Instead, Ferret applies the Visitor pattern to allow developers to
quickly develop powerful filters that can scan for anything (e.g. properties
files, xml, images, video, etc). Ferret even allows developers to modify files
(including Java class files) on the fly. It can also scan for files and
classes across the network.

The fact that Ferret is lightweight, dynamic, fast and easy to use is just
icing on the cake. ;-)
